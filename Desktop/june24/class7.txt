1. difference between Map and set

map
Map contains Key and value pair
 *  if we want value we need to get it through the key
 *  key should never have a duplicate value
 *  value can be duplicate
 
 set
  Insertion order is not maintained. - Unordered collection
 * - We cannot access Set by Index.
 * - you cannot store duplicate values 
 *  - Set allow one null value
 
 2. Hash set Treeset
 
 
 Treeset
  Insertion order is not maintained. - Unordered collection
 * - We cannot access Set by Index.
 * - you cannot store duplicate values 
 *  - treeSet do not allow  null value
 *  - TreeSet is a sorted Set.
 
 
 Hash set
 The HashSet class is an inherent implementation of the hash table data structure
  Insertion order is not maintained. - Unordered collection
 * - We cannot access Set by Index.
 * - you cannot store duplicate values 
 *  - Set allow one null value
 
 
 3.Hasmap and Treemap
 
 We access the value through key
 * hashmap.get(key) to get the value.
 * key cannot be duplicate
 * one null key is allowed
 * values can contain duplicate 
 * Map is an unordered collection  , however we can access using key
 * will not main its insertion order
 
 
4.When to use HashSet HashMap

HashSet is used to access elements randomly. 
It is because elements in a hash table are accessed using hash codes. 
The hashcode of an element is a unique identity that helps to identify the element in a hash table. 
HashSet cannot contain duplicate elements.

HashMap
 hash map is used whenever data is stored as key-value pairs, where values can be added, retrieved, and deleted using keys.
Map contains Key and value pair
  if we want value we need to get it through the key
  key should never have a duplicate value
   value can be duplicate
