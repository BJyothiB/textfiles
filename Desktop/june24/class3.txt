1.    AccessModifiers are public,default,protected and private
we can make variables and methods public,private,default,protected based on requirement.
if the method is public we access the method in class,package,subclass and global
if the method is private we can access only within the class,cann't access in other class,package or global.
if the method is protected we can access with in the class,package,subclass not globally.
if the method is default we can access within the class,package,subclass not global.

Super() we use this for parent class.


2.  final is a keyword 
if the variable is declared final then we cann't reassign the value to that.
if the method is final we cann't overriden it.
if the class is final we cann't extend it.


3.   finally is a block of code which  is used in exception handling 
in this actual code implementation we write in try block and if there any chance of  occurence of exception  then we catch using catch block.
whether exception occurs or not the finally block must be called .

4. finalize method is used in Garbage Collection when there is any unused variable or objects then jvm checks and garbage collection done before the finalize method occurs.
