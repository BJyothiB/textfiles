1.  Main method syntax is

public static void main(String[] args)
{
}

Actual code execution starts from the main method


2.  Shortcuts for main method is 

ctrl+space

system.out.println();

shortcut for this is    syso+ctrl+space

3.   If else conditional statement

The if-else statement tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed.

4. loops

for loop,while loop,do-while loop

The  for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. The Java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program fixed number of times.
If the number of iteration is not fixed, we use while or do-while for loop.

for(int i=0;i<5;i++) //initialization,condition,increment/decrementation

5. switch case
The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions. 

public class SwitchCaseExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    //Declaring a variable for switch expression  
    int number=20;  
    //Switch expression  
    switch(number){  
    //Case statements  
    case 10: System.out.println("10");  
    break;  
    case 20: System.out.println("20");  
    break;  
    case 30: System.out.println("30");  
    break;  
    //Default case statement  
    default:System.out.println("Not in 10, 20 or 30");  
    }  
}  
} 

6.JDK 
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications. It contains JRE + development tools.
The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), jarfiles.

JRE -Java Runtime Environment
 The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications.
 It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
 
7. Arrays 
An array is a collection of similar datatype of elements which has contiguous(/sequence of) memory location.

int []arr =new int[]arr;
int [] array;
array = new int[10]  or
int []arr1 = new int[10];
literal way is      int []array = new[] array{2,5,7,8,4,9};

class TestArray{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
int a[]=new int[5];//declaration and instantiation  
a[0]=10;//initialization  
a[1]=20;  
a[2]=70;  
a[3]=40;  
a[4]=50;  
//traversing array  
for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)//till the length of array  
System.out.println(a[i]);  
}} 

8. premitive
Java provides the mechanism to convert premitive into object. 

int,float,char,boolean,short,long,double,byte 


//Autoboxing example of int to Integer  
public class WrapperExample1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//Converting int into Integer  
int a=20;  
Integer i=Integer.valueOf(a);//converting int into Integer explicitly  
Integer j=a;//autoboxing, now compiler will write Integer.valueOf(a) internally  
  
System.out.println(a+" "+i+" "+j);  
}}  


Wrapper class :  Java provides the mechanism to convert object into premitive.
 
Integer,Float,Character,Double,Long,Boolean,Short,Byte

Integer a=new Integer(3);    
	int i=a.intValue();//converting Integer to int explicitly  
	int j=a;//unboxing
	    
	System.out.println(a+"  "+i+"  "+j); 
	
	
9.Boxing and Unboxing


The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing or boxing.
example byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean, double to Double, and short to Short.

converting premitive to javaobject is called boxing(int to Integer)

converting java object to premitive is called Unboxing(Integer to int)
