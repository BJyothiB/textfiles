Abstraction:
 Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
 There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java.
 
  Abstract class is a class where we add Abstract keyword to the method 
 abstract class has abstract methods and  concrete methods.
 abstract methods has only declaration in abstract class and we do implementation in childclass

Abstract class (0 to 100%)
Interface

Abstract class:
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class.(we add abstract keyword to the method)
 It can have abstract and concrete (non-abstract) methods.
  we cann't create object of the class.
 It needs to be extended and its method implemented.
 
 
Interface: 
interface has only abstract methods.
we can achieve 100% abstraction using Interface.
child class implements interface

Exception Handling:
Exception is an error occurs during the execution of a program.we handle the exceptions in exception handling using Try-catch block.

exceptions are user defined and build in Exceptions.
in build in Exceptions we have  
1. checked or compile time exceptions. ex:IOException
2.unchecked Exceptions or Runtime Exceptions  ex: Arithmetic Exception,ArrayIndex outof bound Exception
