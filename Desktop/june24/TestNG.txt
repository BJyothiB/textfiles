TestNG:
.......
To automate and run all test cases we use TestNg.
In TestNg we run Smoke and Regression Tests.

This is the Order for Execution Ig TestNG

@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterTest
@afterSuite
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


If We have 3 Testcases then the execution order is 

@BeforeMethod (Launching the Browswer,initialisizing the driver)
@Test
@AfterMethod(close the browser)
------
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
..........
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod


we can we one class in one package and other in another package 
we can run using testNg.xml file
we get same the result doen't matter which package they reside in.(the output is same.)


//TestNg.xml file
!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name ="Automation">
@Beforetest
<test name ="login"> </test>
<classes>
<class name="com.Sautomation.testng.LoginTest"/>
</classes>
@AfterTest


@BeforeTest
<test name ="Dashboard"> </test>
<classes>
<class name="com.selenium.automation.LoginTest1"/>
</classes>
@afterTest
</suite>



<parameters   name="username"  value =" abc123@gmail.com"/>


@Test(priority =1)  0,1,-1

//if we don't specify priority 0,1,-1 then test methods execute in alphabetic order


public class Login {
@Test(priority = 1)
public void loginTest() {
System.out.println("Login successful");

}
@Test(priority = 2)
public void registerTest() {
System.out.println("Register successful");
}

@Test(priority = 2)
public void sendEmail() {
System.out.println("Sent email successfully");
}

@Test(priority = 3)
public void logoutTest() {
System.out.println("Logout successful");
}
}

 can see that the two test methods have the same priority. In such cases, TestNG will execute the test methods with the same priority in alphabetical order, i.e.,
 TestNG considers the alphabetical order of ‘r’ and ‘s’ and executes them accordingly. Hence, registerTest() was executed before sendEmail().


What is a TestNG framework?
TestNG is a Framework or Tool:
TestNG is a testing framework for Java that helps in automating tests for your software applications. 
It allows you to write and organize test cases, execute them efficiently, and generate detailed test reports.
